<p>Multi-output learning [1][13] aims to predict multiple outputs for an input, where the output values are characterized by diverse data types, such as binary, nominal, ordinal and real-valued variables. Such learning tasks arise in a variety of real-world applications, ranging from document classification, computer emulation, sensor network analysis, concept-based information retrieval, human action/causal induction, to video analysis, image annotation/retrieval, gene function prediction and brain science. Due to its popularity in applications, multi-output learning has also been widely explored in machine learning community, such as multi-label/multi-class classification [2][8], multi-target regression, hierarchical classification with class taxonomies, label sequence learning, sequence alignment learning, and supervised grammar learning, and so on.</p>

<p>The theoretical properties of existing approaches for multi-output data are still not well understood. This triggers practitioners to develop novel methodologies [5][9][11] and theories [3] to deeply understand multi-output learning tasks. Moreover, the emerging trends of ultrahigh input and output dimensionality [7], and the complexly structured objects [4], lead to formidable challenges for multi-output learning. Therefore, it is imperative to propose practical mechanisms and efficient optimization algorithms [8][10][12] for large-scale applications. Deep learning has gained much popularity in today’s research, and has been developed in recent years to deal with multi-label and multi-class classification problems. However, it remains non-trivial for practitioners to design novel deep neural networks [6] that are appropriate for more comprehensive multi-output learning domains.</p>

<p><small><em>Title: Recent Advances in Neural Machine Translation</em><small></small></small></p>

<p><small><em>Abstract: Machine translation is a challenging machine learning problem as it needs to predict a complex output (a sequence of words) given an input. In this talk, we will present recent advances in neural machine translation, including (1) advanced models, from RNN to CNN and Transformer, (2) improved word representations, e.g., FRAGE, (3) advanced training algorithms, e.g., multi-agent dual learning and dual learning, and (4) efficent infernece, e.g., nan-autoregressive models.</em><small></small></small></p>

<p><small> <em>Title: Syntax-Directed Variational Autoencoder for Structure Output</em> <small></small></small></p>

<p><small> <em>Abstract: Deep generative models have been enjoying success in modeling continuous data. However it remains challenging to capture the representations for discrete structures with formal grammars and semantics, e.g., computer programs and molecular structures. How to generate both syntactically and semantically correct data still remains largely an open problem. Inspired by the theory of compiler where the syntax and semantics check is done via syntax-directed translation (SDT), we propose a novel syntax-directed variational autoencoder (SD-VAE) by introducing stochastic lazy attributes. This approach converts the offline SDT check into on-the-fly generated guidance for constraining the decoder. Comparing to the state-of-the-art methods, our approach enforces constraints on the output space so that the output will be not only syntactically valid, but also semantically reasonable. We evaluate the proposed model with applications in programming language and molecules, including reconstruction and program/molecule optimization. The results demonstrate the effectiveness in incorporating syntactic and semantic constraints in discrete generative models, which is significantly better than current state-of-the-art approaches.</em><small></small></small></p>
